        Venkateswara Temple is an important Vaishnavite temple situated in the
        hill town of Tirumala in Tirupati district of Andhra Pradesh, built by a
        Telugu king. The Temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, an
        incarnation of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared here to save
        mankind from the trials and troubles of Kali Yuga. The temple is
        situated at a height of 853 metres on Tirumala Hills which are part of
        Seshachalam Hills and is constructed in South Indian Architectural
        Style. The first recorded endowment was made by Pallava queen Samavai in
        the year 966 CE. She donated many jewels and two parcels of land (one 10
        acres and the other 13 acres) and ordered to use the revenues generated
        from that land to be used for the celebration of major festivals in the
        temple.[1] The Pallava dynasty (9th century), the Chola dynasty (10th
        century), and Vijayanagara pradhans (14th and 15th centuries) were
        committed devotees of Lord Venkateswara. The temple gained most of its
        current wealth and size under the Vijayanagara Empire, with the donation
        of diamonds and gold.[2] In 1517, Vijayanagara Emperor Krishnadevaraya,
        on one of his many visits to the temple, donated gold and jewels,
        enabling the Ananda Nilayam (inner shrine) roofing to be gilded. After
        the decline of Vijayanagara Empire, leaders from states such as the
        Kingdom of Mysore and the Gadwal Samsthanam worshiped as pilgrims and
        gave ornaments and valuables to the temple.
